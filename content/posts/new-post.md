## üìå What Is Faceless YouTube Automation?

**Faceless YouTube Automation** is the process of running a YouTube channel where the creator remains anonymous, and much of the content production is delegated or automated.

You don‚Äôt record yourself on camera.  
You don‚Äôt do voiceovers (unless you want to).  
You don‚Äôt edit videos manually.  
You may not even write your own scripts.

Instead, you build systems‚Äîor hire a team‚Äîto handle each part of the content creation pipeline.
